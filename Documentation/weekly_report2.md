## Week 2

This week went by creating the foundation of the project. Creating a neural network algorithm from scrath that provides some results.

Currently the  algorithm is able to recognize some images made in Aseprite that are 28x28. The amount of hidden layers, epochs, batch sizes etc needs still some testing to find optimal values.

### Tasks done this week:
- created file structure
- MNIST_loader file that loads the MNIST data
- start.py file that generates the neural network and saves it using mnist loader and network scripts
- imageRecognize function that loads the neural network file and uses it to guess the number
- added some tests
- createt CI pipeline
- created codecov test reporting
