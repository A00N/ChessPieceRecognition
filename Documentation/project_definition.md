# Number recognition

## Project definition
The aim of this project is to create an image recognition AI, that can identify numbers from either existing images, or self drawn ones.

## Algorithms and data-structures
Neural algorithm will be made from scratch. Networks ability to recoqnize numers in images is based on stochastic gradient descent.

## Time and space complexity
Neural network works instantly, and does not take any time on making the prediction.

## Input/Output
Input as an image or by drawing it on tkinet based GUI app, output as text on commandline / on tkinter GUI.
