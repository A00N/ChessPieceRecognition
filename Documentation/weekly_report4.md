## Week 4
This week I fixed a bug that caused validation data to be always around only 10%. Now accuracy is over 97% on both test and validation data.
I introduced draw.py class, which allows to try neural network more efficiently. 
I also manipulated mnist data to produce 250 000 images from the 50 000 images.
I also experiemented with different type of ways to test neural networks.
I also added documentation to the code.

### Tasks done this week:
- Fixed validation data
- Added documentation
- Experiemented on new tests (not pushed to this repo)
