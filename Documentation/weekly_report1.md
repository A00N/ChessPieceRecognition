## Weekly report 1
Most of the time this week was spent on choosing the project as well as researching the subject.

I wanted to work with image recognition AIs and decided to do something different than number recognition, and chess pieces seemed perfect as they can vary a lot.

I am also interested in learning on how to recognice entire chessboard and transfer it into a web version, so this project suits perfectly as a foundation.

Other tasks this week included writing these documents and setting up the project.
