### Implementing

## General structure of the program

## Achieved time and space requirements
Generating neural network takes time based on the amount of epochs, amount of images used and hidden layers. Using the generated neural network is instant.

## Possible shortcomings of the work and suggestions for improvement
Using existing images is bit tricky since there is no GUI for that, but that is due the fact I wanted to focus on the drawing size, where you can draw and check the number instantly.
